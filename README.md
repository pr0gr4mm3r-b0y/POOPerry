Programing oriented objects with Perry the platypus 
This code is about a programing oriented object work that we did in class and it was fun to do, in which we created a class called ornitorrinco which inherits an abstract class   mamifero and implements the following interfaces, ov√≠paro(poner huevos), anfibio(Respirar branqueal y pulmonar) and venenoso to overwrite the method envenenar
